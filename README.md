# sourcetree-custom-actions

A collection of SourceTree CustomActions.

## General
The CustomActions of SourceTree are stored at `~/Library/Application Support/SourceTree/actions.plist`. 
Currently, I have no proper solution to maintain this file automatically. 
Said this, you have to add the receipts yourself to SourceTree.

## License
Feel free to use it. But please contribute any suggestions! Pull request FTW!
